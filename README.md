# BRCA1_TLS_mutagenesis
Supplementary code for the paper "Increased base substitution mutagenesis in the absence of BRCA1 is caused by translesion synthesis and regulated by 53BP1"

These scripts were used in the amplicon sequencing-based analysis of IgV region mutatgenesis in DT40 cell clones of different genotypes.
